All charts development will happen in the __src/app/__ folder.

An empty test chart component has already been created under __src/app/pages/analytics/test-chart/__.

The charts library used is __ng2charts__. It has already been setup and it is ready to use.

Please choose and implement one of the examples found in https://www.positronx.io/angular-chart-js-tutorial-with-ng2-charts-examples/
in the __Line Chart Example in Angular 8__ section.

As always, __Google__ and __Stack Overflow__ are your best friends when having a question.
